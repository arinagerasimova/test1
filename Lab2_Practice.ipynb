    "1. Isolate all real roots for the given algebraic equation, $f(x) = 0$. To solve this problem, you can use any analytical, graphical, or tabular method.\n",
    "2. Correct one of these roots using the combined method by hand (only five iterations).\n",
    "3. Solve the problem of finding all real roots by a Python programming block at the given accuracy $\\epsilon = 10^{-5}.$ Calculate and save required number of iterations.\n",
    "4. Correct the roots by means of the build-in functions. Compare the obtained values and make a conclusion about the rate of convergence.\n"
